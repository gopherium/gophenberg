title: Configuration
description: Every environment variable, what the binary serves where, and what stops startup.
---

Gophenberg is configured entirely through environment variables. A
`.env` file in the working directory is read at startup, and real
environment variables win over it.

## The variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GOPHENBERG_DATABASE_URL` | Yes | | The PostgreSQL connection string |
| `GOPHENBERG_ADDR` | No | `localhost:8081` | Address the server listens on. The container image sets `0.0.0.0:8081` |
| `GOPHENBERG_WEB_DIR` | No | | Where the built admin and the public stylesheets live. The image sets `/web` |
| `GOPHENBERG_SITE_TITLE` | No | `Gophenberg` | The site name shown by the built-in renderer |
| `GOPHENBERG_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | No | | Comma-separated CIDR ranges allowed to set forwarded headers |
| `GOPHENBERG_THEMES_DIR` | No | | The directory themes are installed in, which uploads write to. The image sets `/themes` |
| `GOPHENBERG_MEDIA_DIR` | No | | The directory uploaded media is stored in and served from. The image sets `/media` |
| `GOPHENBERG_THEME` | No | | Pins one theme, overriding the admin. Empty lets the admin choose |
| `GOPHENBERG_NODE_BIN` | No | `node` | The Node binary themes run on. The image sets its own |
| `GOPHENBERG_MEDIA_UPLOAD_CAP_MB` | No | `128` | The largest upload the media library takes, in megabytes |
| `GOPHENBERG_THEME_READY_TIMEOUT` | No | `30s` | How long a starting theme has to answer before it is given up on |
| `GOPHENBERG_THEME_START_ATTEMPTS` | No | `5` | How many times a theme that will not start is tried again |
| `GOPHENBERG_THEME_BACKOFF` | No | `500ms` | How long to wait before the first retry, doubling after each one |
| `GOPHENBERG_THEME_MAX_BACKOFF` | No | `30s` | The longest that wait grows to |
| `GOPHENBERG_THEME_STOP_GRACE` | No | `3s` | How long a theme has to stop before it is killed |
| `GOPHENBERG_THEME_PROXY_TIMEOUT` | No | `10s` | How long a running theme has to start answering one request |
| `GOPHENBERG_FEED_TITLE` | No | `Gophenberg` | The RSS channel title |
| `GOPHENBERG_FEED_ITEMS` | No | `20` | How many posts the RSS feed carries |

Three rows deserve a warning:

- `GOPHENBERG_WEB_DIR` also holds the stylesheets every public
  page loads. Unset, the public site loses its block styling,
  theme or not.
- `GOPHENBERG_SITE_TITLE` only affects the built-in renderer. A
  theme names the site in its own source.
- `GOPHENBERG_MEDIA_DIR` holds files no database backup carries.
  Leave it unset and the media library refuses every upload. Point
  it at a volume that survives a restart, and back it up alongside
  the database.

## Which theme serves

Two things can name a theme, and they do not carry equal weight:

- **`GOPHENBERG_THEME`**, when set, wins. The admin refuses to
  activate, deactivate or roll back while it is set, and a pinned
  theme that fails to load stops the server from starting.
- **The theme chosen in the admin**, stored in the database, governs
  when no pin is set. If it fails to load, the server still starts,
  the built-in renderer serves, and the admin shows the theme as
  broken.

Leaving `GOPHENBERG_THEME` unset is the normal way to run. Pin it
when you want the theme fixed by deployment rather than by whoever
is logged in.

## Trusted proxies

Behind a proxy, requests reach Gophenberg from the proxy's
address, and the headers naming the real visitor and the real
`https` address can be written by anyone. Gophenberg believes them
only from addresses inside `GOPHENBERG_TRUSTED_PROXIES`.

Leaving it unset behind a proxy causes two quiet problems: any
absolute address a theme builds comes out as `http`, and the login
rate limiter sees all visitors as one client, so a few failed
logins by anyone can lock out everyone.

## What stops startup

The server refuses to start, and says why, when:

- `GOPHENBERG_DATABASE_URL` is missing.
- `GOPHENBERG_TRUSTED_PROXIES` is not valid CIDR notation.
- `GOPHENBERG_FEED_ITEMS` is not a positive whole number.
- `GOPHENBERG_MEDIA_UPLOAD_CAP_MB` or `GOPHENBERG_THEME_START_ATTEMPTS`
  is not a positive whole number.
- Any of the theme timings is not a positive duration. Write them the
  way Go does, `30s`, `500ms`, `1m`.
- `GOPHENBERG_THEME_MAX_BACKOFF` stands below
  `GOPHENBERG_THEME_BACKOFF`, which would leave no room to grow.
- `GOPHENBERG_THEME` pins a theme that fails to load, see
  [installing a theme](/themes/installing-a-theme/). A theme chosen
  in the admin does not stop startup.

## What the binary serves where

| Path | What | Login needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | The public site, the default type's newest items | No |
| `/{path}` | One published item at its stored address | No |
| `/{routeword}` | A [content type](/guides/content-types/)'s archive | No |
| `/page/{n}`, `/{routeword}/page/{n}` | Older items behind the page word | No |
| `/media/...` | Uploaded files and their derived sizes | No |
| `/admin/` | The admin | The screens ask for one |
| `/api/...` | The admin's JSON API | Yes, apart from signing in and out |
| `/api/content/v1/...` | The [public content API](/reference/content-api/) | No |
| `/api/plugins/feed/rss.xml` | The [RSS feed](/reference/rss-feed/) | No |
| `/gophenberg/...` | Site assets, cached for an hour | No |
| `/_gophenberg/...` | Reserved for internal use | Answers 404 |

The last row answering 404 from outside is correct behavior, not
an outage.
