title: Updates and backups
description: How to upgrade safely, what to back up, and how to restore it.

Two operational jobs: keeping Gophenberg current, and being able
to put it back after something goes wrong.

## Updating

Your compose file pins an exact version, so nothing updates behind
your back:

```sh
# 1. edit compose.yaml: change the image tag to the new version
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Migrations run automatically when the new version starts. While
Gophenberg is below 1.0, read the release notes first, since a
release can change behavior.

Updating to %VERSION% runs two migrations on start: one adds
[fields](/guides/fields/) to the schema, the other adds the
relation table connecting content to content. Back up the database
before the first start on this release, as before any update.
Public addresses do not change shape.

Rolling this release back is not free. Fields now live in
[field groups](/guides/fields/), and the rollback puts each field
back on the single content type its group names. A group placed on
every type, on several types, or by a rule that excludes one loses
its field definitions, because there is no single type to give them
back to. The values those fields held stay in the database, but the
definitions do not return if you migrate forward again. Take a
backup before rolling back past this release.

This release serves themes built on `@gophenberg/astro`
%KIT_VERSION%, and refuses any other, naming what it found. Rebuild
and reinstall your theme against that kit before updating. Which
kits an update serves is in the release notes, and
[theme compatibility](/themes/compatibility/) explains how long a
built theme keeps working.

## What to back up

**The database**, which holds everything you wrote:

```sh
docker compose exec -T db pg_dump -U postgres -Fc gophenberg > gophenberg.dump
```

The `-T` is required: without it Docker attaches a terminal that
corrupts the binary dump, and you find out when the restore fails.

**Your compose file and any `.env` beside it**, the only place
your configuration and passwords exist.

**The media volume**, which holds every file you uploaded. The
database records what each file is called and where it lives, but
never the file itself, so a lost volume leaves a library of broken
pictures no dump can repair:

```sh
docker compose cp gophenberg:/media ./media-backup
```

Back it up whenever you back up the database. The two have to come
back together, or the library and the files disagree.

**The themes volume**, if you upload themes in the admin. An
uploaded theme exists only there, so a lost volume means
re-uploading every theme:

```sh
docker compose cp gophenberg:/themes ./themes-backup
```

Which theme is active is stored in the database, not in the
volume, so both have to come back for the site to look the same.
Themes you install by hand need no backup, they are rebuilt from
their source projects.

## Restoring

Restore into a database Gophenberg has never started against,
because startup creates tables that make the restore fail:

```sh
docker compose up -d db
docker compose exec -T db pg_restore -U postgres -d gophenberg < gophenberg.dump
docker compose up -d
```

Starting only the database first is what keeps Gophenberg out of
the way until the restore is done.
