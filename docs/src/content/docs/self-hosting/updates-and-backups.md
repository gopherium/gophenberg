Two operational jobs: keeping Gophenberg current, and being able
to put it back after something goes wrong.

## Updating

Your compose file pins an exact version, so nothing updates behind
your back:

```sh
# 1. edit compose.yaml: change the image tag to the new version
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Migrations run automatically when the new version starts. While
Gophenberg is below 1.0, read the release notes first, since a
release can change behavior.

## What to back up

**The database**, which holds everything you wrote:

```sh
docker compose exec -T db pg_dump -U postgres -Fc gophenberg > gophenberg.dump
```

The `-T` is required: without it Docker attaches a terminal that
corrupts the binary dump, and you find out when the restore fails.

**Your compose file and any `.env` beside it**, the only place
your configuration and passwords exist.

Themes need no backup, they are rebuilt from their source
projects.

## Restoring

Restore into a database Gophenberg has never started against,
because startup creates tables that make the restore fail:

```sh
docker compose up -d db
docker compose exec -T db pg_restore -U postgres -d gophenberg < gophenberg.dump
docker compose up -d
```

Starting only the database first is what keeps Gophenberg out of
the way until the restore is done.
